# Alexiares_LPF V4

This repository contains the fourth version of the Low Pass Filter project of the OpenHPSDR Alexiares frontend


This work is protected by the TAPR Open Hardware Licence https://www.tapr.org/ohl.html

Original work by Graham Haddock, KE9H and Phil Harman, VK6APH.

3D image of the board are stored in the **image folder**

The main difference with the original filter is the integration of the 54 MHz lpf which is not in permanent use anymore.
In this version, C69 is not mandatory 


Board's dimensions are oversized : 10x15cm 

Former version should not be used as the 4 layer drawing causes important capacitive problems 

A VNA measurement of the filter will be added as soon as possible
